It has proven to be a very lookrative marketplace for App developers as users needs and wants are diversifying and increasing. Catering to such ever increasing user needs need constant development and updation.\n",
        "Currently, the two largest global platforms for app distribution are Appleâ€™s App Store (for iOS Smartphone users) and Google play store (official app store for the Android smartphone users). For our research, we have picked Google play store and did a thorough analysis of its features that were available to us for predicting the success of a particular app. The huge number of apps in the play store and the numbers of the app released every day make it quite competitive for the app developers, the companies who are building an app to come up with a unique idea that will definitely be bought by the end users. Because at the end of the day if the app does not perform well in the android market, then all the hard work behind building the app will go in vain.\n",
        "It is crucial for businesses to find out what type of apps people are downloading, what are their needs and sentiments, how does size, price and category type impact Ratings and sentiments of apps, before developing an app and listing that on play store."
